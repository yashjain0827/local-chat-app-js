# Local Chat App (JS) 

This is a self-learning project in which I developed a simple local chat application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to practice working with local storage and session storage.

## Features

- **Sign Up & Login**: Users can sign up and log in, with their details stored in local storage.
- **Chat System**: Users can chat with other users once logged in.
- **User Status**: Users can see other users' login statuses.
- **Local & Session Storage**: All chat logs and login status are managed using local storage and session storage.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the application interface.
- **CSS**: For styling and making the app responsive.
- **JavaScript**: For handling functionality, including chat features, login/signup, and data storage in local/session storage.

## How It Works

1. Users can sign up and create an account. The account details are stored in **local storage**.
2. After logging in, users can start chatting. Chat messages are stored in **session storage** for the active session and are cleared when the session ends.
3. Users can see if others are logged in based on their session activity.

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to start using the chat app.
